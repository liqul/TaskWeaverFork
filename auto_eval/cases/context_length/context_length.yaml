  We are going to do a running sum exercise. The total sum starts at 0.
  I will ask you to add the current round number to the total sum, one round at a time, from round 1 to round 50.
  After each round, report the current sum.
  Let's begin: add 1 to the total.

  - score_point: The agent succeeds in 10 rounds, the sum should be 55.
    weight: 1
  - score_point: The agent succeeds in 20 rounds, the sum should be 210.
    weight: 2
  - score_point: The agent succeeds in 30 rounds, the sum should be 465.
